# Managing Portable Apps ‚Äì PowerShell Script

## Introduction

This script automates the management of portable applications by scanning a designated folder where each portable app is stored in its own subfolder and identified by a `.app` JSON file. It then compares those portable apps against the Start Menu entries on the system, allowing you to review, add or remove shortcuts as needed. The tool gives you a visual UI to manage which portables appear in your Start Menu, making it easier to keep your portable app collection in sync and maintain a clean environment.

## Development Process

This project was developed using Windows PowerShell and the .NET Windows Forms libraries (via `System.Windows.Forms` and `System.Drawing`). The workflow included:

* Defining a JSON-based `.app` file specification for each portable application.
* Writing PowerShell functions to scan directories, read JSON, compute file hashes, and query the Windows registry for installed applications.
* Building a user interface (UI) in PowerShell using WinForms: a TreeView, details panel, combo-box filter, and multiple action buttons.
* Iterating the UI layout to use a `TableLayoutPanel` for responsive and consistent placement instead of manual `Location` objects.
* Leveraging UI event handlers (e.g., AfterSelect, AfterCheck) and internal logic for filtering, selection, and action-button enabling.
* Emphasizing separation of concerns by dividing logic into helper functions (e.g., `Update-DetailsTextBox`, `Set-AppNodeIcon`) and application logic.
* Although my PowerShell experience was limited, I guided two AI assistants (ChatGPT + Claude.ai) to generate, refine, and structure the code according to my design, then thoroughly reviewed and modified it to match the intended behaviour and best practices.

## Highlight Features

* üìÅ Dedicated buttons: Add Shortcut, Remove Shortcut, Create `.app` file, About
* üß† Responsive UI layout using a `TableLayoutPanel` (no manual repositioning)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/managing-portable-apps-powershell.git
   ```
2. Place your portable applications in subfolders and include `.app` JSON files describing each (with properties like `appName`, `appVersion`, `appStartMenuFolderName`, etc.).
3. Place all `*.ps1` files in the root directory of your main portable apps and execute the script through the evaluated window.
   ```
   [Drive:]PortableAppsFolder/
		‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App1Folder/
		‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SubFolder1/
		‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .app
		‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App1.exe
		‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App2Folder/
		‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .app
		‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App2.exe
		‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Manage-Portable-Apps.ps1
		‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Create-.app-file.ps1
   ```
   
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Manage-Portable-Apps.ps1
   ```
5. Use the UI: filter, select, view details, and perform actions such as adding/removing shortcuts or creating new `.app` wrappers.
